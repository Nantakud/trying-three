        <p>Welcome to my experiment with THREE</p>

      <p id="sentence1">
        The first object is a torus, or better a giant donuts. No icing on top,
        but it is very red. It has two light pointed over it, and it moves not
        too quickly in three directions.
      </p>

      <p id="sentence2">
        The second item is an icosahedron. It has 20 faces, and it rembembers me
        of some dices I used to do role playing. To style it a little bit, I
        added a normal map with floreal patterns, and a question mark. A orange
        light from above completes the creation. It obviously rotates.
      </p>

      <p id="sentence3">
        The third object is a torus too, but this time around it comes in a knot
        fashion. I made it pink, to match the stars coloro and it looks like a
        giant candy.
      </p>

      <p id="sentence4">
        I just started with a youtube tutorial, and added some twists here and
        there. Not too enthusiast of the result, but it's fair enough as fist
        attempt. I think I'm gonna try something more extreme next time Thanks
        for watching, I hope you enjoyed
